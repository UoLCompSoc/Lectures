# Introduction to Linux - Worksheet

Some of the tasks below will require you to search through the documentation of that command. 
You can do so using the 'man example' command, where 'example' is the command you wish to lookup.


For each of the following create a single command that can:

1. List the files and driectories in your home directory and sote the results in a file called 'task1.txt'

2. List all of the files and directories in your home directory including all those that are hidden, and store the result in a file called 'task2.txt'

3. List all of the files in your home directory, store the result in the file 'task3.txt', then create a new folder 'task3', and append the list of file to the existing file 'task3.txt'

4. Output the contents of any file of your choice to the file 'task4.txt'
Hint: You will need to make use of the 'cat' command

5. If the file 'task5Example.txt' exists, then output the contents of it to the file 'task5.txt'
Hint: You will need to make use of the 'test' command

6. Output the result of a full recursive listing of all your file in your home directory and output the result to a file 'task6.txt'

7. List the files and directories in your home directory, and output this to the file 'task7p1.txt'. 
Then add the folder 'example' in your home directory.
Again list the files and directories in your home directory, and output this to the file 'task7p2.txt'.
Using the diff tool compare these two files and output the difference to the file 'task7.txt'
